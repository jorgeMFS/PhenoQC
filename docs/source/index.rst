Welcome to PhenoQC's documentation!
==================================

PhenoQC is a lightweight, efficient, and user-friendly toolkit designed to perform comprehensive quality control (QC) on phenotypic datasets. It ensures that data adheres to standardized formats, maintains consistency, and is harmonized with recognized ontologiesâ€”facilitating seamless integration with genomic data for advanced research.

Key Features
----------------------------------------------------

* **Comprehensive Data Validation:** Checks format compliance, schema adherence, and data consistency against JSON schemas.
* **Ontology Mapping:** Maps phenotypic terms to standardized ontologies (HPO, DO, MPO) with synonym resolution and optional custom mappings.
* **Missing Data Handling:** Detects and optionally imputes missing data using various strategies (mean, median, mode, KNN, MICE, SVD).
* **Batch Processing:** Processes multiple files simultaneously in parallel.
* **User-Friendly Interfaces:** Provides both CLI and GUI interfaces.
* **Reporting and Visualization:** Generates detailed QC reports and visualizations with improved formatting.
* **Class Distribution (Optional):** Provide a label column to get a class-imbalance summary and warning.
* **Imputation Parameters & Quick Tuning:** Configure imputation parameters and optionally run a mask-and-score tuner.
